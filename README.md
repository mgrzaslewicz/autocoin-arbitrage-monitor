Hi, decentralized exchanges would be really good, as then you could utilize flash loans from Aave
Any chance to have added Sushiswap, Aave V2, Uniswap V2, Curve, Yearn, Compound ?

I would like to see uniswap(v1 V2 v3) , 1inch and sushiswap

Not sure if I'm reading this correct but I notice that DIA/usdt is saying 1.53% I selected market depth of 100,500 and 1000 but when I go to kucoin to buy etc. The withdraw fee is about 20$. U may only break even for an amount bought at 1283$. If u buy in the amount of $100 or $500 u will loose but the monitor  shows 1.5% profit
